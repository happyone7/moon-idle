# Web Games (Sub-skill)

Use with `game-development` when target platform is browser/HTML5.

## Apply These Constraints First

1. Browser compatibility and input model (desktop + touch).
2. Performance targets on low-end mobile browsers.
3. Save strategy and offline behavior.
4. Deployment pipeline and cache invalidation.

## Deliverables

- Platform constraints summary.
- Browser QA matrix.
- Performance and memory budget.
- Release checklist (including save compatibility).
