# MoonIdle Concept Art Direction

Use this skill for MoonIdle-specific concept art and art asset direction.

## Vision
- Technical credibility first, sci-fi drama second.
- Mission-control realism with playable readability.
- "Engineer in the room" mood: steel, piping, control monitors, test data, vibration, heat haze.

## Art Pillars
1. Core mood
   - Early game: cleaner layouts, higher contrast, clearer icon readability.
   - Late game: denser panels, higher detail, more thermal effects.
2. Color hierarchy
   - Primary: cool blue + cyan accents.
   - Secondary: warm caution orange for risk, warning, heat.
   - Neutral: steel gray with brushed-metal grain.
3. Surface language
   - Repeating hardware textures, exposed rivets, vent lines, cable bundling.
4. UI coherence
   - Panel borders, buttons, and feed displays should share a common frame motif.
5. Story grammar
   - Show progression from prototype lab -> operational launch pad -> orbital complexity.

## Scene Priorities
- Control Hall (overview, operations)
- Assembly Bay (queue stacks, progress)
- Payload Integration (fine assembly detail)
- Engine Bay (heat and pressure)
- Lunar Approach (optional cinematic extension scene)

## Production Rules
- Never mix fantasy sci-fi motifs with this theme.
- Keep text readable if used as HUD texture.
- Preserve metal textures, panel line work, and utility labeling patterns.
- Prefer real-world engineering reference over dramatic fantasy elements.

## Deliverable Checklist
- 10+ candidate panels per concept pack.
- 5 hero backgrounds.
- 20+ reusable UI assets (button variants, frame variants, corner decals).
- One "production master pack" set per sprint.
