# Industrial Space UI Art

Use this skill when designing game UI for technical, engineering-first space fantasy.

## Audience Lens

- Engineering students and systems-minded players.
- Fans of SpaceX mission architecture and launch operations.

## Art Direction Rules

1. Industrial control-room tone over cartoon polish.
2. Emphasize data surfaces:
- telemetry tables
- KPI strips
- status lights
- queue timelines
3. Use layered depth:
- background concept art
- translucent panels
- technical grid overlays
- animated scan/glow lines
4. Motion language:
- restrained, utility-like transitions
- progress sweeps, signal pulse, radar loops

## UI Structure Pattern

1. Left: resources and production pipes.
2. Center: mission timeline, research/upgrade consoles.
3. Right: assembly slots, launch queue, quality diagnostics.

## Visual Checklist

- Engineering typography + high-contrast numerics.
- No generic mobile-app look.
- Keep interactions readable under dense information.
